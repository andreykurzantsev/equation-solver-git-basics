# Solver of quadratic equations
 This is a console application for solving quadratic equations written in C++

## Description 
***
This program has 2 modes of operation:
+ Interactive
+ Non-Interactive
The program is able to solve quadratic equations of any complexity.
## Compilation and using
***
* To run the program interactively, compile the app.cpp file. And run the received .exe file.
### For example: 
```
>g++ app.cpp
>./a.exe
```
* To use the non-interactive mode, you must also compile the code, and then specify the path to the file with coefficients as a command line argument. The file must have a .txt extension. The contents of the file with coefficients should look like a\sb\sc\n, where '\s' is a space and '\n' is a newline. If you fill out the file differently, you will receive an error message. You can use my file: coefs.txt or create your own.
### For example: 
```
>g++ app.cpp
>./a.exe C:\directory\projectspace\coefs.txt
```
#### Enjoy using
